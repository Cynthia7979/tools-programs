# Chatbot
Directly Copied from 
[How to build a chatbot in less than 50 lines of code](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/41655/how-to-build-a-chatbot-in-less-than-50-lines-of-code)
of [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com) Playground.

I simply spammed some quotes from the forum of [scp-wiki.net](http://scp-wiki.net) into forum.txt,
and copied some random SCiP's into scp.txt. The results are interesting.

I wish one day I can build my own chatbot or neutral network!
