# Minecraft Anvil File Editor
For programmically mass-editing Anvil files. *Not* intended to have any functionalities outside of what I need, but you are welcome to fork/copy/download and meddle with the code yourself.

This project will only support **1.20.1** formats.

I'm making this because I need to mass-edit Minecraft save files but both Python libraries for this use case (`anvil` and `nbt`) are outdated and barely usable.
