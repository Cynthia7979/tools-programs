# LITTLE_BOOK_OF_HAPPINESS
Not really a "tool," but more like a game. This program is a pop-idea, rendered to implement the features of a sloppy disk. A reference would be the sloppy disks in the game *Else Heart.Break();*

This is only a demo of its features. The complete program with all "happiness" is being used as my diary. So it's rare that this program would be updated.
