So here is this child called Cynthia. She is under 10, apparently.This child called Cynthia belongs to a religion called the Beholders of Truth. It is a squeamish religion, because it always believes that it holds the truth, and that any truth recommended by outsiders are complete lies.Cynthia follows the three creeds of the BoT: 1) Do not believe in science 2) Only receive knowledge from the Elder 3) The Book of Truth is always true But one day, a tender middle-aged man became the Elder.Let¡¯s not discuss why a middle-aged would become the Elder, because that¡¯s how things go.The man, whose name is James, is open to suggestions. Indeed, he is a bit too easy to convince.Through him, even a tiny member is able to change the religion completely.And that¡¯s why - abruptly - the BoT becomes a faithful believer of practical magic, or Thaumaturgy.
