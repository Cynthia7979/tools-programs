# TuringBot: A Minimized Chatbot

Meet `TuringBot`, a chatbot that passes the Turing test... as
long as the humans responsible have never talked to another human,
physically, in their entire life.

`TuringBot` works just as how most of us respond to virtual
small talks these days: We recognize others' emotion by their
message, and randomly choose a response from our mental fast
reply cache.

Is it really a Turing test-passing bot? Maybe not, but at least
it pretends to understand what you're talking about - just like
a human.
