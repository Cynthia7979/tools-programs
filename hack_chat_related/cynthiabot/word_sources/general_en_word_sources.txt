Hello Cynthia7979, you have made 583 classifications to date.
Dictionaries are a convenient way to store data for later retrieval by name (key). Keys must be unique, immutable objects, and are typically strings. The values in a dictionary can be anything. For many applications the values are simple types such as integers and strings.
It gets more interesting when the values in a dictionary are collections (lists, dicts, etc.) In this case, the value (an empty list or dict) must be initialized the first time a given key is used. While this is relatively easy to do manually, the defaultdict type automates and simplifies these kinds of operations.
A defaultdict works exactly like a normal dict, but it is initialized with a function (“default factory”) that takes no arguments and provides the default value for a nonexistent key.
A defaultdict will never raise a KeyError. Any key that does not exist gets the value returned by the default factory.

Mention Your Achievements: Employers look for staff who have a history of making positive contributions.
Review each of your experiences and ask yourself if there are achievements in class, clubs, sports, or the workplace that you can include.
If so, use verbs like enhanced, reorganized, increased, improved, initiated, upgraded, or expanded to show what you accomplished.
