You could try making it scream funny things referencing other scips like say "THE SCULPTURE IS BEHIND YOU" or something like that :)
Thank you for letting me know what "crit in 12 hours" meant I'll remember for future reference.
The masks attaches itself to the subjects skin becoming a part of it at first.
Overtime the mask takes over, and the subject will become the creature on the mask. If the mask is a werewolf mask then the subject becomes a werewolf.
The reason the old man makes masks is currently unclear, for he continues to allude capture.
Him and the shop appear around halloween when masks are at the peak of their sales.
When halloween night is over he disappears.
With his shop. The masks do indeed have a compulsion effect , an alluring voice heard by the person who bought the mask telling them to put it on.
The shop is an incognito hazard in terms of people aren't surprised by it showing up over night.
The mask maker appears to only appear in small towns, not bigger cities as far as the foundation have seen.
I think this needs more development before it can really go anywhere
"Squirrels that make you terrified" is, as you pointed out, not that groundbreaking. Not every idea has to be AMAZING, but this one feels like a rushed concept, with not much meat on its bones.
As it is, I find it hard to believe that much more than a description of these events in action could be used as story element.
Checking back in after ages, and find this rewritten.
I take it my original got downvoted to deletion?
If it was in the dumps, then props to Roget for the rescue.
This forum is for ideas, not for drafts.
Hi, i only joined this site yesterday but i've been interested in this site and SCPs for a long time and have wanted to write an SCP for a while, and i finnaly think i've got a pretty decent idea.
Is ecologism a new religion exclusive to the Spanish wiki?
Nice to see you agree, but the differences could also be massive.
I'm honestly impressed by how much personality you somehow managed to infuse into a single ball bearing that kinda does nothing but hop out of boxes and roll a bit, and the fact that this tiny, harmless little thing is classified as Keter works wonders to put the Foundation's objectives into perspective.
+1 from me.
Why must you put two spaces in between words D:
I definitely agree.
So, I'm curious to, if this idea hasn't been done before, what sort of story would it have?
Hi! I like to practice traditional art, but I want to learn digital. I love drawing people and buildings, but digital art is very difficult for me. I like different styles of art, mainly animation and book illustration. I have never been to art school. I do take lessons from my grandma. I would be interested in colour challenges.
Is it all right if I ask family/friends to take poses for me ? (with at least underwear of course) I'm more at ease with living persons to do this and since I have the possibility, I prefer to watch and draw for real instead on videos. I do understand though that it is not an option for everyone (unles syou go sketching in a park, but people will be clothed)
Thank you ! I was wondering if it was anatomy drawing, you know like having an undressed person taking poses before art students that you have to draw. In French, we call it modèle vivant. I wasn't sure about it but you gave me confirmation about the exercise.
I think the logs here are fantastic, really enjoyed those. This was highly compelling to read. I don't think it was really necessary to use as many collapsibles as you did but that's more a personal matter of taste. +1
I have to address this now: the url is not the same as the one from the original. It should "incriveis-sapatos-ozwalds" be.
I had the LETTERS Entertainment form the Chinese branch.
Pocket Panzer is a new studio which is specially creaHi, I'm Moscarific (or Mosca, for short)! I'm nonbinary and use they/them/their pronouns. I've been lurking for a bit and wanted to join so I can vote, comment, and discuss. I might contribute as a writer someday but for now am enjoying what is already here!
I have a strong scholarly background in literature and history of medieval and early modern Europe, especially Spain and the British Isles. I speak fluent Spanish, pretty good Japanese, and bits and pieces of a number of other languages. (My current language project is Vietnamese, mostly so I can read restaurant menus.) Feel free to hit me up with questions on these topics, or if for some reason you need information on competitive figure skating, musical theater, or cocktail mixology.
I floated over here from the land of fan fiction, and you can read my work on my Archive of Our Own page, if that interests you.
ted.
Right, but I wasn't really getting that connection from the "human aspect" that you were mentioning. I read it over a couple more times and I think I understand it. The GOC agent here would use an SRA to effectively break a hole in reality as a means of exploring another, right?

There’s a saying in photography that for every 100 pictures you take, only one turns out good.
Something similar could be said about drawing, for every 10 sketches you do there’s maybe one worth pursuing.
Well, this month we’re going to celebrate that unsung hero of artistic talent: Bad Art!
We try so hard to get that one good picture done we tend to forget about all the work and abandoned art we do to get to that point.
It’s also easy to get discouraged from finishing a picture when it’s not coming out good, so this month forget about perfection!
Embrace the bad. Bad art is also the cornerstone of creativity!
It’s there we are encouraged to push our art beyond our comfort zone, because we already know it’s not gonna turn out great, so you can’t ruin it by trying something different.
If a picture isn’t coming out well then go at it even harder, throw some crayon on it, paint those shadows black, cover it in glitter, cut it out and paste it on a new picture.
If it’s already bad then you can’t make it any worse right?
So just get it finished, even if the outcome is less than perfect.
Love your bad art!
