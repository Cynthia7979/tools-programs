It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.
The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.
There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.
Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.
Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.
A day without sunshine is like, you know, night.
A woman is like a tea bag; you never know how strong it is until it's in hot water.
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.
This life is what you make it
No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth
But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up
Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway
But just remember, some come, some go
The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends
Don't let go of them
Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world
As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too
And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate
You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything
Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything
Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.
It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
