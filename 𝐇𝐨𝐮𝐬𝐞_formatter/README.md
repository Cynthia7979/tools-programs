# 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 Formatter for Chrome and Opera (GX)

This is a lightweight browser extension for Chrome, Opera, Opera GX, and other browsers with a Chromium core.
Inspired by [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofleaves/comments/jjlhjb/references_to_𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞_of_leaves_in_pop_culture/), this browser extension will automatically swap any occurrences of
the string "House" into "𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞" on any webpage.

To install:

1. Clone or download this repository, or if you'd like, only this directory
2. Open your favorite Chrome-core web browser and navigate to the Extensions page
3. If needed, enable Developer Mode by clicking on the switch next to the text "Developer Mode"
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button on the page
5. Select the directory this README.md file is in
6. Accept any requested permissions and you're good to go!
