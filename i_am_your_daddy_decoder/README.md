# I Am Your Daddy Decoder
This tiny program originated from a secret message written on several classmates' notebooks:
```
I am your daddy
  By- 1,12,6,15,14,19,15
```
After running this program while other students were spending their time carefully counting through the alphabet,
we deciphered the message - believed to be written by someone named Alfonso.

However, the real Alfonso refused to admit that he wrote the message.
Several students in our class concluded that it must be someone using Alfonso's name who did this terrible work
(terrible that numerous notebooks have been abused).
