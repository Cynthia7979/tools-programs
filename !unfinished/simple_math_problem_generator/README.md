# "Simple" Math Problem Generator
(Quoted that soon it won't be simple anymore)

**Quick Note:** `simple_math_problem_generator.py` is a experimental file for 
simple a+b only. `math_problem_generator.py` is the most comprehensive one 
(and not yet finished).

**Requirements** ่ง`Math Problem Generator.xmind`
